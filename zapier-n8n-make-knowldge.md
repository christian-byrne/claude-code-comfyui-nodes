## Key Areas to Focus On

1. **Node/Module/Action Architecture**
   - How do they define reusable components?
   - Input/output specifications
   - Configuration schemas

2. **Data Flow & Transformation**
   - How data passes between nodes
   - Data mapping interfaces
   - Expression languages for transformations

3. **Execution Models**
   - Trigger mechanisms (webhooks, schedules, events)
   - Sequential vs parallel execution
   - Error handling and retries

4. **Visual Programming Paradigms**
   - How they represent workflows visually
   - Connection types and constraints
   - Conditional logic and branching

5. **Integration Patterns**
   - Authentication methods
   - API abstraction layers
   - Common integration patterns

## Questions to Answer

1. How do these platforms define and structure their "nodes" or "modules"?
2. What are the common patterns for data transformation between steps?
3. How do they handle authentication and API connections?
4. What are their execution models (synchronous, asynchronous, streaming)?
5. How do they represent conditional logic and branching?
6. What are their error handling and retry mechanisms?
7. How do they handle data types and schema validation?
8. What are their webhook and trigger architectures?
