# Reddit Thread to TikTok/YouTube Short Video Script

Transform a Reddit thread into an engaging narrated script for short-form videos (under 60 seconds).

## Input Requirements

You will receive Reddit thread data in JSON format containing:
- Post information (title, content, author, score)
- Comment threads with replies and metadata
- Top comments by score and engagement

## Script Creation Process

### 1. Analyze the Thread
- Identify the main topic/question/controversy
- Find the most engaging comments (high scores, controversial, funny, insightful)
- Look for dramatic moments, plot twists, or surprising revelations
- Note any technical explanations that need simplification

### 2. Create Hook (First 3-5 seconds)
Start with an attention-grabbing opener:
- "You won't believe what happened when..."
- "This developer asked Reddit for advice and..."
- "The programming community is divided over..."
- "Someone just discovered the worst code ever..."

### 3. Script Structure (45-55 seconds total)

**Opening Hook (3-5 seconds)**
- Dramatic question or statement
- Set up the scenario

**Context Setup (10-15 seconds)**
- Briefly explain the original post
- Who asked what and why it matters
- Keep technical details simple

**Main Discussion (25-35 seconds)**
- Present 2-3 top comments that:
  - Provide different perspectives
  - Show controversy or debate
  - Offer surprising insights
  - Include funny or memorable quotes
- Use phrases like "But then someone replied..." or "The top comment said..."

**Conclusion/Cliffhanger (5-8 seconds)**
- Summarize the outcome or ongoing debate
- Ask viewers what they think
- Tease follow-up content if applicable

### 4. Script Formatting

Format the output as:

```
